# Filterbank-CSP Implementation in Python


<span style="font-size:10em;"> Filterbank CSP is a common benchmark used during comparison of novel methods of motor imagery classification research. However, many currently existing implementations of it are rather slow, do not work properly, or do not use the original data sources of the BCI Competition IV Dataset II a and II b motor imagery training and evaluation trials, making replicability very difficult, and a lot of work in papers just going towards re-establishing a baseline model. This repository is meant to help with this. </span>
